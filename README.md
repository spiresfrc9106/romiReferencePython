# RomiReference

This is forked from https://github.com/robotpy/examples/tree/main/RomiReference

This repo python source code based upon [RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/docs/) - [RobotPy at readthedocs.io](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) -
code for the [Romi]( https://github.com/robotpy/examples/tree/main/RomiReference).

Robotpy add a Python programming environment to the [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) software
development environment for [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) robots, for Python development. Prior to robotpy, FRC
robots were programmed in C++ or Java.

## TL;DR

For those in the "too long; didn't read" camp, here are the steps to get Python program, using RobotPy and WPILib,
controlling an Romi.  These instructions are for a Windows PC, but similar steps should work on a Linux computer or
a Mac.


### Steps

* [Download and install wpilib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases) - TODO need to verify this step is needed with RobotPy
* Follow **some** of the steps in https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/Romi-robot/hardware-and-imaging.html and https://Romiusersguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/building.html
  * Note 1: If you follow the complete video, it uses [Romi Code from WPI (https://Romicode.wpi.edu/)](https://Romicode.wpi.edu/) 
    to test out the robot build. Which is a different development environment than
    the [FRC Control System](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) development environment firmware that these steps
    load into the Romi.
  * Note 2: Follow the [steps](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html):
    * Getting Started with Romi
      * Romi Hardware, Assembly and Imaging
      * Getting to know your Romi
      * Romi Hardware Support
      * The Romi Web UI
      * But stop before "Programming the Romi"
* Make sure your computer is reconnected to the internet and not your Romi
* [Download and install Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/)
* Download this repo from https://github.com/spiresfrc9106/romiReferencePython
  * If you downloaded as a zip file, unzip into a directory
  * Open a Windows PowerShell Window
    * Because RobotPy uses the `pyproject.toml` that is in `romiReferencePython` the Change directory (cd) to the directory where you downloaded and perhaps unzip `romiReferencePython`:
       ```commandline
       cd C:\Users\MikeStitt\Downloads\first\sw\romiReferencePython
       ```

       ```commandline
       pwd
       ```
    
       results in:

      ```commandline
       Path
       ----
       C:\Users\MikeStitt\Downloads\first\sw\romiReferencePython 
       ```
       for reference, a dir command
       ```commandline
       dir
       ```

       results in something like this:

       ```commandline

       Directory: C:\Users\MikeStitt\Downloads\first\sw\romiReferencePython

       Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

       ```
    * Verify that your Python command is python 
       ```commandline
       python -VV
       Python 3.12.1 (tags/v3.12.1:2305ca5, Dec  7 2023, 22:03:25) [MSC v.1937 64 bit (AMD64)]
       ```
    * Install RobotPy
      ```commandline
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      python -m pip install robotpy
      python -m pip install robotpy-halsim-ws --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
      ```
      
    * The above results in an error message like:
      ```commandline
      <- SNIP ->

    * From the `romiReferencePython` directory, do a RobotPy sync:
      ```commandline
      python -m robotpy sync

      pip is launching in a new window to complete the installation
      ```
  * Connect a **wired-only USB** xbox controller to your PC. This can be confusing because some xbox controllers have
    a USB connector for charging, but are **wireless** xbox controller. These will not work. Logitech xbox controllers
    will work, if the switch on the back of them are switched to the "X" mode using the  "X" or "D" switch on the back
    of the controller.
  * Powerup the Romi
  * Connect to the Romi WiFi network
    * Network is something like `WPILibPi-` TODO and a bunch of characters
    * Password is: `WPILib2021!` 
  * The first time we need to update the romi firmware:
    ```To start firmware imaging, first connect the Romi's micro USB-B port to one of the Pi's USB-A ports. A USB data cable is required (many phone charging cables are power only). Connecting this cable can cause the Romi or Pi to reset, so it's recommended this be done when the Romi is powered off.
    ```
  * Connect to the Romi in a web browser `http://10.0.0.2/`

    * We need to switch to the romi tab
    * We need to make it writeable
    * We need to press the update firmware button.
    * Also suggest pressing the calibrate gyro button.
    * Disconnect the USB to micro usb cable.
  * Go back to your Windows PowerShell Window.
    * This step can be confusing for those that know how to simulate and deploy to full-sized FRC robots. Use RobotPy to
      launch the WPILib simulator to control the Romi from the Windows PowerShell that is in the `romiReferencePython` directory:
      ```commandline
      python -m robotpy sim --ws-client
      ```
      resulting in:
      ```commandline

  * Drive your Romi around with your xbox controller joysticks. TODO, on a Logitech controller the rotate left and right is backwards.
